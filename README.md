# Rust_todo-list_

Rust To-Do List
Welcome to your first Rust project: a simple To-Do List application that allows you to manage tasks. This program supports adding, listing, marking tasks as complete, removing tasks, and even prioritizing and setting due dates for tasks.

Features:
Add tasks: You can add new tasks to your to-do list with descriptions and optional due dates.
Mark tasks as complete: Once you finish a task, you can mark it as "Completed" or toggle its status back to "Pending".
Remove tasks: You can remove tasks from your list by specifying their unique task ID.
Prioritize tasks: Assign priorities to tasks (Low, Medium, High).
View tasks: List all tasks, along with their status, priority, and due date.
Persistent storage: Tasks are saved to a local file, so they persist even after you close the programm.
